This is the website where most lectures, R application exercises and supplementary materials are developed for the course MP223 Applied Econometric Methods for the Social Sciences (SoSe 2022). it is not a substitute of [course Ilias](https://ilias.uni-giessen.de/goto.php?target=crs_301421&client_id=JLUG) or [course StudIP](https://studip.uni-giessen.de/dispatch.php/course/details?sem_id=b1775c5097d2a85c2986b7667d22c3dc&again=yes) pages, but rather a convenient way of making the slides accessible, downloadable and nice.
